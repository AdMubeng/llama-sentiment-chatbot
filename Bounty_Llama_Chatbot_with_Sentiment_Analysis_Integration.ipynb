        "In this project, we enhanced a Llama 2 chatbot by integrating sentiment analysis to adjust the chatbot’s responses based on user sentiment. The chatbot first checks a QA dataset for predefined answers and uses the Llama 2 model to generate new responses when necessary. Sentiment analysis was implemented using a Hugging Face pipeline to detect positive or negative sentiments. The chatbot adjusts its tone and responses accordingly, offering more empathetic answers when negative sentiment is detected, or friendly and positive responses for users in a good mood. This project showcases the capability of AI to provide more emotionally intelligent interactions.\n"
